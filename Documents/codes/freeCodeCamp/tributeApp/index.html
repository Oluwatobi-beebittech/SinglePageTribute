                Born on the 27th of October 1956, she is credited to have helped stem the 
                spread of the Ebola virus by detaining the Liberian index case, Patrick Sawyer,
                and resisting the pressure mounted on her by Liberian officials to release him
                to go for an upcoming conference. She died in the afternoon of 19 August 2014 days 
                after she tested positive for Ebola virus.
